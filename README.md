# coding_challenges

Created a repo with sample exercices (and my suggested solutions) both for myself and for Le Wagon students who are interested in practicing more.

Every exercise folder includes an exercise file and a solution file - both of which have tests that I built. All you need to do is run the file and you'll get all the feedback you need! Rspec tests will be implemented in the near future.
