# Write a program that prints all the integers from 1 to 100.
# Here's the trick though:
# You are not allowed to have numbers on your code.
#Â For example, the following lines are not valid:
# number = 1
# four = 2 + 2
# for i in 1..100
# i += 1
# Come up with three different ways to do it!
# There are no tests (yet) for this.
