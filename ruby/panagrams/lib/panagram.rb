# A panagram is a sentence that contains every single letter of the alphabet at least once.
# Example: "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog"
# Build a method that checks for panagrams.
# Return true if it is, false if not.
# Must be case insensitive, and ignore space and punctuation.

def panagram?(string)
  # TODO: return true if string is a panagram, otherwise retun false.
end

# TESTS
