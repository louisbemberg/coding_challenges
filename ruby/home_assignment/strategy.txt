Q1)

- First, we need to get the data off the web.
- How does this API work? It gives us a chunk of text as well as a next page
- Our goal is to get all chunks of text of each page
- When do we stop? When there's no more next page?
pseudocode:

# LOOP STARTS HERE => STOP LOOPING WHEN THERE'S NO NEXT PAGE
  #Â request data from the API's url
  # extract the words, add them to our complete string.
  # extract the next page URL
# LOOP ENDS HERE

Great, the data is off the web and now into our program. We could now start counting each word:

# Find a way to extract only the words from the string
# create an empty hash
# iterate over the words and gradually add their count to the hash
# sort the hash first by count, then alphabetically


We now have 2 working functions/methods. One that extracts, the other that counts

Now all is left is to prompt the user for an API url via the terminal (in a different file maybe?)
